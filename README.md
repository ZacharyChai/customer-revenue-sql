# Customer & Revenue Analytics Using SQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to answer core business questions related to revenue performance, customer behavior, and product trends using transactional retail data.

The focus is on writing clean, business-oriented SQL queries rather than complex modeling.

- How does revenue change month over month?
- Who are the top customers by total spend?

## Data Model
The analysis is based on a normalized relational schema:
- Customers
- Orders
- Order Items
- Products
